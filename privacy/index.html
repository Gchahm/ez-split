    <h1>Privacy Policy for Your App Name</h1>

    <p>Last Updated: 13/09/2024</p>

    <p>
      EzSplit is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
      explains how we collect, use, and disclose your information when you use
      our Android application (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Photo Uploads:</strong> When you use the camera functionality in
      our App, you may upload photos of receipts. These photos are sent directly
      to our chat model for processing and are not stored on our servers or in
      any database.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We process the uploaded photos to extract and interpret receipt data. Our
      main purposes for using your data include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Analyzing the photo to generate a list of items and their prices based
        on the receipt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Saving only the generated list of items and prices in our database for
        future reference and improvements.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We do not store the photos you upload. The only information retained is
      the processed list of items and their prices generated from the receipt.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share or sell your uploaded photos with any third parties. The
      processed data (list of items and prices) may be shared in aggregate form
      for analytical purposes, but this data will not identify you in any way.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We prioritize the security of your data and apply appropriate technical
      and organizational measures to protect it against unauthorized access,
      alteration, or destruction.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to request access
      to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data. If you wish to
      exercise any of these rights, please contact us at
      <a href="gustavoch.dev@gmail.com">gustavoch.dev@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are
      advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>
